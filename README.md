# Fitness-Activity-Fair-Management-System
Fitness activity fair management system. Project for DBMS course, where I have careted the relational database for a hypothetical 
on-campus hosted fitness activity fair.

The project also implements an extensive use of PL/SQL as a programming language to write procedures. 

The procedures contains all the basic structs of PL/SQL such as variables, conditional statements, looping, arrays, etc.

Any enthusiast who is interested to learn and get an hands on with SQL along with Pl/SQL, this project could act a great starter.

Feel free to reach out to me for any assisstance.
